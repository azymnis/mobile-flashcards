# Mobile Flashcards

This is the final project deliverable for the react native part of the udacity react nanodegree. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Installation

This project requires expo for testing. [See here](https://expo.io/learn) for installation instructions of expo.

To start this project locally:

    yarn install
    yarn start

Or using npm:

    npm install
    npm start

And then you can open the app in your ios emulator by pressing `i` or the android emulator by pressing `a`.
You can run this on your own device by scanning the given QR code in the expo app on your device.

## Supported devices

I have tested this locally on an iPhone X emulator, as well as a Google Pixel 7.1.0 emulator.
This app seems to work fine on both iOS and Android. I have also tested this on my personal iPhone 7 plus.
